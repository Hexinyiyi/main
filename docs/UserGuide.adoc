== Introduction

iScheduler Xs Max is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for scheduling personal events*. More importantly, this version is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, we can get your event scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `iScheduler Xs Max.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your iScheduler Xs Max.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all events
* **`add`**`add n/CompanyAInterview s/22 September 2018 9am p/high` : adds an Event named `CompanyAInterview` to the Event Scheduler.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd event shown in the current event
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
