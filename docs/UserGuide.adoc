== Introduction

iScheduler Xs Max is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for scheduling personal events*. More importantly, this version is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, we can get your event scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `iScheduler Xs Max.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your iScheduler Xs Max.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`add`**`add n/Interview at Jane Street` : adds an Event named `Interview at Jane Street` to the Event Scheduler.
* *`list`* : lists all events
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd event shown in the current event
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format* +
 -- Some commands have (an) alias(es), which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add an event to the scheduler, you can type either `add n/Interview at Jane Street` or `a n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/EVENT_NAME`, `EVENT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/EVENT_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Interview at Jane Street t/serious` or as `n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/priority.low`, `t/fun t/serious` etc. +
 -- Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/EVENT_NAME v/VENUE`, `v/VENUE n/EVENT_NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help` +
Aliases: `hel` OR `he` OR `h` +
_Coming in V1.3: Command format is case-insensitive_

=== Adding an event : `add`

Adds an event to the scheduler. +
Format: `add event n/EVENT_NAME [s/START_DATETIME] [e/END_DATETIME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [v/VENUE] [rt/REPEAT_TYPE] [ru/REPEAT_UNTIL_DATETIME] [t/TAG]…` +
Aliases: `ad` OR `a` in place of `add` +
_Coming in V1.3: Command format is case-insensitive_

[TIP]
An event can have any number of tags and reminders(including 0).
If you want multiple tags and reminders, we need to use `[t/]` and [`re/`] for multiple times

* `DATETIME` is the natural language of date and time in English. (see 3.2.1 - 3.2.4)
* `REPEAT_TYPE` should be chosen from either daily, weekly or monthly.
* `TAG` should be chosen from the list of tags. Tags can be expressed as an integer(index) or in alphabets.
* `REMINDER_TIME` is in the format of XX `H` XX `M` XX `S` (case-insensitive), which represents the duration before the `START_DATETIME` that we want to have a pop-up alert. (see 3.2.5)

Examples:

* `add n/Study With Yoko s/tomorrow at 3pm d/Study again and again rt/MONTHLY ru/next friday 3pm t/adhoc re/30M`
* `add n/CS2103 Lecture s/23 September 2018 6pm e/24 September 2018 rt/WEEKLY ru/next monday t/timetable re/1H30M`
